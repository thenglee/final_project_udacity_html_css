#### About

This project is part of [Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) portfolio and is the final project of [Udacity's Intro to HTML and CSS course](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud304).

#### Project Tasks

Based on the [design mockup file](https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/3158088581/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf),

1. Identify the various boxes you will need to build in order to recreate this design.

2. Write your HTML and CSS files, continue to iterate until your work is representative of the design mockup.

3. Take the time to personalize your portfolio with custom colors, additional content and your own images.

4. Validate your HTML and CSS against the W3C's Validators. *Note: the validators consider the following errors, whereas Udacity accepts these errors as acceptable:*

  - HTML5: Bad value X-UA-Compatible for attribute http-equiv on element meta when using the X-UA-Compatible meta tag.
  - CSS3: Property [some property here] is an unknown vendor extension when using vendor prefixed properties (like -moz-box-sizing).
